### `üöß` Upcoming Features & Focus for `dev`
This branch is where new ideas and improvements are being tested. Here's a glimpse of what's being worked on or planned:

-   üöÄ Implementing hybrid command handling (Slash & Message Commands).
-   üèóÔ∏è Major refactoring for a better, more maintainable project structure.
-   üéº Dedicated Music Request Channel feature.
-   üõ†Ô∏è Utilizing the latest development version of **[CommandKit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commandkit) (`@dev`)**.
-   ‚ú® Integrating the newest updates from **[Riffy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/riffy) (`latest`)**.
-   ‚úÖ Sticking with CommonJS for now.
-   üí° And many more enhancements and experimental features!

### `üìù` Developer Note
> "I want my code to at least look good if the function is bad or something."
>
> This branch also serves as a space to experiment with code style and organization. While functionality is key, readability and a clean codebase are also priorities here.

### `üìç` Core Requirements (May change with development)
-   Node.js `v18` or higher
-   MongoDB `v5` or higher
-   Spotify API credentials
-   Lavalink server [**[Check above](https://github.com/Beban-Studio/Aria-Melody/tree/dev#available-lavalink-for-testing)**]
-   **Note for `dev` branch:** Ensure compatibility with `commandkit@dev` and the latest `riffy` version, which might have different or newer requirements as development progresses.
